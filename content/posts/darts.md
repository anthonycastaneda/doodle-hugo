## What Is Cricket (Darts)?

Cricket is a darts game where players **race to “close” specific numbers** *and* score points on them **before their opponent does**.

It’s equal parts accuracy, strategy, and psychological warfare.

---

## The Numbers That Matter

Only these count:

**15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and Bullseye**

Everything else on the board is meaningless (emotionally and legally).

---

## Objective

To **win**, you must:

1. **Close all the numbers**, *and*
2. Have **equal or more points** than your opponent

You can’t just close numbers and lose on points. That’s called *hubris*.

---

## How to Close a Number

Each number needs **3 hits** to be closed.

* Single = 1 hit
* Double = 2 hits
* Triple = 3 hits (insta-close, very satisfying)

Once closed, **extra hits score points** *unless* your opponent has also closed that number.

---

## Scoring

* Points are only earned on **open numbers** (numbers your opponent hasn’t closed yet)
* Score value = the number hit

  * Triple 20 = 60 points
  * Bullseye = 25 (outer) or 50 (inner)

Once **both players close a number**, it’s dead ☠️. No more scoring there.

---

## Turn Structure

* Each player throws **3 darts per turn**
* Misses happen. Ignore them.
* Trash talk is optional but traditional.

---

## Example Turn

You throw:

* Triple 20 → closes 20 immediately
* Single 20 → scores 20 points (opponent hasn’t closed it yet)
* Single 19 → 1 hit toward closing 19

You are now *winning* and *smug*.

---

## Strategy Basics

### Early game

* Close **20s and 19s** fast (highest scoring)
* Triples matter more than singles

### Mid game

* Decide: **score or close?**
* If you’re ahead on points → close aggressively
* If behind → score like a menace

### End game

* Watch the scoreboard more than the board
* Deny opponents scoring opportunities
* Panic slightly (normal)

---

### Common Variations

* **Cut-Throat Cricket**
  Points you score go to your opponents instead. Friendship-ending.
* **No Bull**
  Bullseye doesn’t count (for people afraid of math).
* **Team Cricket**
  Chaos, yelling, alliances.

---

### How People Actually Lose

* Closing everything but being behind on points
* Ignoring the bull too long
* “Just one more triple” thinking
* Playing angry (darts can smell fear)

---

## Trash Talk

Ah. **Cricket trash talk** — the most important *unwritten rule* of the game 🎯
This is less about insults and more about *psychological weather control*.

---

## What Cricket Trash Talk *Is*

* **Low-volume**
* **Perfectly timed**
* **Plausibly deniable**

You’re not yelling.
You’re **planting doubt**.

---

## The Golden Rules

1. **Never trash talk before your own dart hits**

   * That’s how the board humbles you.
  
2. **Say less than you want to**

   * Silence is threatening.
  
3. **Tone matters more than words**

   * Calm confidence hurts more than insults.

---

## Core Trash Talk Categories

### The Polite Knife

Delivered gently. With concern.

* “Ooh—*that was close*.”
* “You’ll find it.”
* “Unlucky.”
* “That’s okay, you’ve still got two.”

Damage: **Severe**

---

### The Scoreboard Reminder

You’re not mocking—you’re *observing*.

* “Just need… all of those.”
* “That’s still open, by the way.”
* “You sure you wanna score there?”

Best used while pointing casually at the chalkboard.

---

### The Fake Coaching Moment

Pretend you’re helping. You are not.

* “You might wanna close that.”
* “Triples are on the inside.”
* “Bull’s been good to people tonight.”

This creates **overthinking**, your true ally.

---

### The Post-Miss Sympathy Pause

Say nothing.
Wait two seconds.
Then:

* “…yeah.”
* “Huh.”

This is elite-level. Use sparingly.

---

### The Self-Deprecation Trap

You miss on purpose? (You didn’t.)

* “I’m terrible tonight.”
* “I can’t hit anything.”

Now you immediately hit a triple.

Opponent morale collapses.

---

### The Rule Clarifier

Weaponized knowledge.

* “That one doesn’t count.”
* “That’s closed already.”
* “Bull’s still live for you.”

Delivered neutrally. Like a librarian.

---

## Advanced Techniques

### The Confidence Borrow

Act like *you* expect their dart to miss.

* Look away early
* Start writing the score mid-throw
* Nod *before* it lands

This is borderline sorcery.

---

### The “Your Dart Is Fine” Curse

Never do this unless you mean harm.

* “That dart’s flying great tonight.”

They will immediately lose it.

---

## What NOT to Do

* Loud insults (rookie behavior)
* Commenting on grip/stance mid-throw (never ever)
* Talking during release (illegal in spirit and generally shitty)
* Celebrating *too hard* (the room turns on you)

If someone calls you out for trash talk, you’ve failed.

The best Cricket trash talk:

* Sounds accidental
* Feels personal
* Leaves no evidence

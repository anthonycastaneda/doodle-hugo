Playing a **rock show in a small club** as a drummer is about *power with control*. You want the band to hit hard without overwhelming the room or wrecking the mix. Here’s a practical, gig-tested guide.

## Tune, Size, and Gear Choices (Small Room = Smart Choices)

![C'mon, man](/img/big-kit.jpg)

>Not everyone has access to more than one drum kit, but if you do, bring your smaller kit to the small club

1. Drum sizes

   * Smaller kick (22" or even 20") = punch without boom
   * 12" rack tom / 14" floor tom are plenty
   * Deep drums can overpower tiny rooms

2. Heads

   * Coated heads tame brightness
   * Slight muffling on kick (small pillow or pad)
   * Avoid wide-open ringing toms

3. Cymbals

   * Thinner cymbals = faster decay, less wash
   * Darker rides/crashes sit better in tight spaces
   * Smaller crashes (16–18") often sound bigger *in context*

>**Hardware tip**
>
> Bring memory locks or compact stands—stages are cramped and changeovers are fast

If you aren't the headliner, get your drums the hell off the stage
as quickly as possible.  <strong>**GET OFF THE STAGE**</strong>

## Volume Is Everything (You Set the Ceiling)

As the drummer, **you control the band’s volume**, whether you mean to or not.

>**Golden rule:**
>
> If you’re too loud acoustically, no PA can save the mix.
>

1. How to play loud *without* being loud

   * Hit **snare center**, not a rimshot every time
   * Lay back on cymbals, especially hi-hats
   * Play kick confidently, not harder
   * Save full power for choruses and endings

2. Pro move

   * Play at ~80% during soundcheck
   * Adrenaline will push you to 100% naturally during the set

## Work *With* the Sound Engineer

Even in tiny clubs, there’s usually someone running sound.  They are your best friend.  Be nice to them.

1. Before the set

   * Ask what they’re going to mic (often just kick + overhead)
   * Adjust tuning and your playing volume if requested — this earns instant goodwill
   * Don’t test blastbeats; play real grooves

2. During the show

   * If cymbals aren’t mic’d, *you are the cymbal mix*
   * If monitors are bad, lock into feel, not volume
   * Don't bitch about the monitors on mic.  Use subtle hand signals to tell the sound engineer what you need.

## Groove Over Chops (The Room Hears *Feel* First)

Small rooms exaggerate everything.

1. What works

   * Deep pocket
   * Clear backbeat
   * Strong dynamics between sections

2. What doesn’t

   * Busy ghost notes nobody can hear
   * Endless fills between vocal lines
   * Overplaying cymbals to “feel energy”

If the crowd is moving their heads, you’re winning.

## Stage Presence (Without Taking Up Space)

You’re visible—even behind a kit.

1. Body language

   * Big motion on accents
   * Sit tall, confident posture
   * Lock eyes with bandmates on changes and full band hits

2. Between songs

   * Stay relaxed
   * Don’t noodle endlessly
   * Count-in songs confidently and clearly

---

## Logistics That Matter in Small Clubs

These things separate pros from chaos:

* Bring a **rug** (kicks slide on bar floors)
* Keep cases stacked tight backstage **(do not block fire exits)**
* Know your fastest teardown order (again, get the hell off the stage)
* Carry spare sticks *within arm’s reach*
* Keep ~~beer~~ water nearby — but not where it can spill on pedals

## Mental Game: You’re Driving the Night

In a small club:

* The crowd is *right there*
* Mistakes feel bigger—but groove matters more
* Energy transfers instantly

>**Think like this**
>
> You’re not showcasing drums—you’re making the room move.
>

**Play with control, hit hard only when it matters, respect the room, and make the band sound huge without actually being loud.**
